### 🧠 Simulated Output: *Manager Perspective – Letting Go of a Willing but Underperforming Employee*

---

**📍 Context Review**

You're about to have a conversation with an employee who has **not improved despite mentorship**, but who is **not resistant** or insubordinate. Their lack of progress seems tied to **overwhelm, unclear expectations, or structural gaps** in training or support.

Your task is to navigate this termination with **legal care**, **emotional intelligence**, and **cultural awareness** of your company’s fast-paced, competitive environment.

---

### 🧰 Pre-Conversation Preparation

1. ✅ **Review documentation**:

   * Ensure PIP or performance logs are complete
   * Confirm the employee was given fair and clear expectations
   * Ensure mentor notes or session logs support the decision

2. ✅ **Check company legal/policy compliance**:

   * Performance-based terminations should be clearly documented
   * If applicable, confirm if the employee is part of any protected class

3. ✅ **Human context check**:

   * Are they early-career, neurodiverse, returning from leave, or in a learning curve?
   * Have you (or the system) unintentionally created an impossible bar?

### 🗣️ Suggested Language for the Conversation

> *“I want to acknowledge how difficult this moment is — for both of us. You've shown genuine effort and have sought help through mentorship, and that’s not lost on me. Unfortunately, the gap between expectations and current outcomes hasn't narrowed in a way that aligns with our business needs, and we’ve made the decision to end your employment effective \[insert date].”*

> *“This decision is not a reflection of your work ethic or integrity. I believe the structure and pace of this environment didn’t support you in the way you needed. That’s on us too.”*

> *“We’ll walk you through the separation logistics, but I also want to ensure you're treated with dignity. Let’s talk about how we can support your next step — whether that’s a reference, resume guidance, or connecting you to others in the field.”*

---

### 🤝 Aftercare + Team Messaging

* Offer a **written summary** of the termination including any severance, final pay, COBRA/benefits, and resources.
* Avoid phrases like “not a culture fit” — it’s vague and legally risky.
* Provide HR-approved talking points for teammates to ensure **clarity without gossip**.
* Consider manager coaching:

  > *How can I better identify early signs of overwhelm before it becomes a separation?*

---

### 💬 Tone and EQ Considerations

* Avoid performative empathy (e.g., “I know exactly how you feel”)
* Be brief, kind, and **stay away from blame or sugarcoating**
* Acknowledge their effort: *“I saw you trying.”*
* Reinforce that this is a **system-driven decision**, not a personal failure

---

### 🧭 Closing Reminder

**This isn't about punishing someone — it's about recognizing misalignment.**
The most ethical exits happen when **effort is honored**, even if outcomes fell short.

You are responsible for delivering a hard message, yes — but **how** you do it matters as much as **what** you say.

Let me know if you'd like this converted into:

* 💼 A coaching email template
* 📄 A HR-compliant PDF script
* 📊 A slide for manager training decks

Would you like the next simulation to reflect a different region (e.g., UK/EU), or handle a more hostile conversation?
